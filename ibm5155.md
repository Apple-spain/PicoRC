## Getting a Pico PSU

PicoPSUs are tiny ATX power supplies for small PCs, but are perfect for retro computers as well.

![Alt text](photos/mac_plus/pico.jpg)

* [Official website](https://www.mini-box.com/DC-DC) and [distributors](https://www.mini-box.com/site/resellers.html).

* The cheapest **80W** one should be plenty for the **floppy-only** model.

* The **160W** variant is recommended if using many expansion cards and/or the **spinning hard drive**.

* Avoid generic clones. They over-rate and are of low quality.

* A **12V DC** power brick with **center positive** 5.5x2.5mm barrel jack is needed.

* They are very popular and you might already have one. Make sure it has enough wattage.

### Soldering Notes

Nothing too tricky in this kit, all basic through-hole stuff.

If this is your first time, a few tips:

* Make sure your soldering iron has **proper temperature control**. Try your local makerspace or university lab.

* Use **leaded solder** and plenty of flux, temperature around 320C / 600F.

* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqvHogekDI4) covers the basics pretty well.

### Assembly

Solder the components **as shown below**:

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/topside.png)

* Double check capacitor polarity!

* Black electrolytic caps: White stripe is **NEGATIVE**.

* Blue Tantalum caps: White stripe is **POSITIVE**.

* Yellow ceramic caps: No polarity.

### Cleaning

This is optional, but I like to clean off the flux with 90%+ isopropyl alcohol.

Submerge and scrub with a toothbrush.

Make sure it is **completely dry** before proceeding.

### Inspection

* Compare with the photo and notes above. Make sure everything is in correct orientation.

* Solder joints should be **shiny and smooth**. If you see spikes, put on more flux and melt it again.

* There must be **no solder bridges**. If any, put on flux and melt it to remove.

### Bracket

Install the metal bracket.

The shorter side should be touching the PCB.

Secure with M3 screws from the bottom.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/short.png)

Then install the ISA bracket, secure with two more M3 screws.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/brackets.jpeg)

## Installation

Install two 5A fuses.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/fuses.jpeg)

Use a multimeter to **check for dead shorts** between each power rail and GND:

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/fingers.png)

If all good, plug in PicoPSU, and flip the switch.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/test.png)

The LED should light up. The LED is wired to the `POWER_GOOD` signal, so there might be a slight delay.

Measure the voltage of each rail, make sure they are correct. 

---------

Undo the locking ring on the barrel jack.

Insert through the hole on the bracket.

Tighten the ring from the other side. Use 10mm socket.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/jack.jpeg)

Insert the power cables into the terminal blades.

* Match the colours! (RED: 5V | ORANGE: PowerGood | BLACK: GND)

* Ensure the connectors are **all the way in**.

* Ensure the **insulating sleeves** are in place.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/conn.png)

Now we're ready to install!

**⚠️⚠️ Insert the blanking plug into the power socket. ⚠️⚠️**

This prevents the old faulty/unknown PSU from being accidentally energized.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/5155plug.jpeg)

(1) Unlatch the keyboard.

(2) Release, unplug, and remove the keyboard.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/unlatch.png)

Undo six screws on the face plate.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/face.png)

Slide the outer case backwards to remove.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/outcase.jpeg)

Undo three screws and remove the RF cage.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/rf.png)

Unplug the floppy cable and all power connectors to free up some space.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/og.jpeg)

Plug the adaptor into an ISA slot.

The outmost one is recommended.

Secure with screw.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/inslot.jpeg)

Insert a flat-blade screwdriver into the blade receptacle.

Expand the gap slightly so it goes in easier.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/expand.png)

Time to insert the power cables.

Push **straight down**, make sure **lobe side faces outwards**.

**Don't force** if there is significant resistance, make the gap bigger and try again.

Of course, it shouldn't be too loose either.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/lobe.png)

**RED is +5V**, can be **any** of the three pins on the left.

**BLACK is GND**, can be **any** of the four pins in the middle.

**ORANGE is Power Good**, the rightmost pin.

Make sure they are **all the way in**, and covered with **insulation sleeve**.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/fff.png)

Double check again with the photo above.

Next, plug in the CRT power cable.

Check that the **purple wire faces left (12V)**.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/crtconn.jpeg)

Put the machine on its face, undo the two screws for the cable cage.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/cablecage.jpeg)

Feed the CRT power cable through the opening.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/open.jpeg)

Unplug the connector labelled P12, might be tight, be gentle go slow.

Plug in the new power connector. **Make sure the color match!**

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/p12.jpeg)

Reinstall the cable cage.

## Moment of Truth

Now we can power on and find out if it works!

If the 5155 is of unknown condition, it is **highly recommended** to **start minimal** with just the motherboard and video card. Remove all extra cards and disconnect the drives.

Plug in and flip the switch!

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/working.jpeg)

If it works, congrats! You can now add more parts back in.

If nothing happens, the tantalum capacitors on the +12V and -12V line are often the culprit, you can simply remove them. [More info here](https://minuszerodegrees.net/5150_5160/MDC/tantalum_short_plus_12volts.htm).

--------

For drives, use the harness that came with the PicoPSU.

## But I Want to Use the Big Red Switch™!

So far, everything we've done is **non-destructive**.

However, you can keep going and wire up the Big Red Switch™ so it can be used to power on/off the machine.

However, it requires **further disassembly** and **cutting a few wires**, so it's up to you. Keep reading to see if it's too much.

### How It Works

There is a **PSW header** on the adaptor.

The PSU will turn on when the **two pins are shorted together**.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/psw.jpeg)

So we are going to take apart the old PSU, and wire up the Big Red Switch™ to those pins!

### Steps

Follow the guide above, disassemble until the removal of the cable cage.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/cablecage.jpeg)

Only this time, feed all the power cables through the opening.

Also unplug the purple-and-black CRT power connector.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/out.jpeg)

Remove the five screws securing the old PSU.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/psuscrew1.jpeg)

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/psuscrew2.jpeg)

Lay the machine flat.

⚠️ **SLOWLY** ⚠️ slide the PSU outwards. **It might be tight initially, DON'T RUSH!**

⚠️ **BEWARE OF CRT NECK of all times!** ⚠️ Feed in the cable as you go.

⚠️ **Don't bump the neck!** ⚠️ It's game over if it's broken.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/neck.jpeg)

Eventually, you'll completely remove the PSU.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/psuout.jpeg)

Remove the four screws shown to open it up.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/psucase1.jpeg)

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/psucase2.jpeg)

Yikes!

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/yikes.jpeg)

The Big Red Switch™ is a Double Pole Single Throw (DPST) switch, which switches two circuits at once.

Note the colour of the wires.

The **same colored** wire are **connected together** when the switch is on.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/dpst.png)

⚠️⚠️ **MAINS VOLTAGE flows through this switch!!!** ⚠️⚠️ For safety, we'll need to disconnect those wires.

**UNPLUG** the connector, and **CUT** the other two wires.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/cut.jpeg)

Now the Big Red Switch™ should be completely isolated.

Double check that this is the case.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/unplugged.jpeg)

Attach the test clips to one side of the switch.

You can also solder the wires directly to the terminals.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/clipped.jpeg)

Tuck all the original wiring inside the case. We won't be using them anymore.

Make sure they don't knock loose the test clips.

Now the Big Red Switch™ wires should be the only thing that exits the case.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/tuck.jpeg)

It's also a good opportunity to replace the original cooling fan.

Any good quality **80mm PC fan** should work.

Don't discard the **black metal bracket!** It shields the CRT from the electromagnetic field of the fan motor. Without it, the picture will wobble.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/pcfan.jpeg)

With the new fan, **TAPE OVER THE HOLE** of the old wire harness to improve cooling efficiency.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/modded.jpeg)

Now reinstall the PSU.

⚠️ CAREFUL WITH THE CRT NECK ⚠️

Don't forget to thread the CRT connector through the opening in the bottom.

Connect it back up. Make sure the colors match.

Reinstall the cable cage.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/poke.jpeg)

Plug the fan header and power switch header into the adaptor.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/newconn.jpeg)

That's pretty much it! Test to make sure it works, and reassemble!
