The PSU-in-a-Card replaces the original PSU, and uses very common **12V power brick** instead.

## Getting a Pico PSU

PicoPSUs are tiny ATX power supplies for small PCs, but are perfect for retro computers as well.

![Alt text](photos/mac_plus/pico.jpg)

* [Official website](https://www.mini-box.com/DC-DC) and [distributors](https://www.mini-box.com/site/resellers.html).

* The cheapest **80W** one should be plenty for the **floppy-only** model.

* The **160W** variant is recommended if using many expansion cards and/or the **spinning hard drive**.

* Avoid generic clones. They over-rate and are of low quality.

* A **12V DC** power brick with **center positive** 5.5x2.5mm barrel jack is needed.

* They are very popular and you might already have one. Make sure it has enough wattage.

## Kit Assembly

### Soldering Notes

Nothing too tricky in this kit, all basic through-hole stuff.

If this is your first time, a few tips:

* Make sure your soldering iron has **proper temperature control**. Try your local makerspace or university lab.

* Use **leaded solder** and plenty of flux, temperature around 320C / 600F.

* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqvHogekDI4) covers the basics pretty well.

### Assembly

Solder the components **as shown below**:

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/topside.png)

* Double check capacitor polarity!

* Black electrolytic caps: White stripe is **NEGATIVE**.

* Blue Tantalum caps: White stripe is **POSITIVE**.

* Yellow ceramic caps: No polarity.

### Cleaning

This is optional, but I like to clean off the flux with 90%+ isopropyl alcohol.

Submerge and scrub with a toothbrush.

Make sure it is **completely dry** before proceeding.

### Inspection

* Compare with the photo and notes above. Make sure everything is in correct orientation.

* Solder joints should be **shiny and smooth**. If you see spikes, put on more flux and melt it again.

* There must be **no solder bridges**. If any, put on flux and melt it to remove.

### Bracket

Install the metal bracket.

The shorter side should be touching the PCB.

Secure with M3 screws from the bottom.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/short.png)

Then install the ISA bracket, secure with two more M3 screws.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/brackets.jpeg)

## Pre-flight Checks

Install two 5A fuses.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/fuses.jpeg)

Use a multimeter to **check for dead shorts** between each power rail and GND:

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/fingers.png)

If all good, plug in PicoPSU, and flip the switch.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/test.png)

The LED should light up. The LED is wired to the `POWER_GOOD` signal, so there might be a slight delay.

Measure the voltage of each rail, make sure they are correct. 

## Installation

Undo the locking ring on the barrel jack.

Insert through the hole on the bracket.

Tighten the ring from the other side. Use 10mm socket.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/jack.jpeg)

Insert the power cables into the terminal blades.

* Match the colours! (RED: 5V | ORANGE: PowerGood | BLACK: GND)

* Ensure the connectors are **all the way in**.

* Ensure the **insulating sleeves** are in place.

Now we're ready to install!

**⚠️⚠️ Insert the blanking plug into the power socket. ⚠️⚠️**

This prevents the old faulty/unknown PSU from being accidentally energized.

(1) Unlatch the keyboard.

(2) Release, unplug, and remove the keyboard.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/unlatch.png)

Undo six screws on the face plate.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/face.png)

Slide the outer case backwards to remove.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/outcase.jpeg)

Undo three screws and remove the RF cage.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/rf.png)

Unplug the floppy cable and all power connectors to free up some space.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/og.jpeg)

Plug the adaptor into an ISA slot.

The outmost one is recommended.

Secure with screw.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/inslot.jpeg)

Insert a flat-blade screwdriver into the blade receptacle.

Expand the gap slightly so it goes in easier.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/expand.png)

Now take a look at the AT-style connector.

We just need to insert the cables into the appropriate pins.

Other rails will be fed through the ISA bus.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/rails.png)

Let's start with the **RED** 5V cable.

Any will do, but I suggest the rightmost pin, easier to remember.

Push **straight down**, make sure **lobe side faces outwards**.

Don't force if there is significant resistance, make the gap bigger and try again.

On the other hand, it shouldn't be too loose either.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/lobe.png)

Repeat with the other two wires.

**BLACK** GND wire can be any of the four pins in the middle.

**ORANGE** PG wire is on the other end.

Make sure they are **all the way in**, and covered with **insulation sleeve**.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/fff.png)

Double check the connection:

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/ttt.png)

Plug in the CRT power cable.

Double check that the **purple wire faces left (12V)**.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/crtconn.jpeg)

Put the machine on its face, undo the two screws for the cable cage.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/cablecage.jpeg)

Feed the CRT power cable through the opening.

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/open.jpeg)

Unplug the connector labelled P12, might be tight, be gentle and take your time.

Plug in the new power connector. **Make sure the color match!**

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/p12.jpeg)

Reinstall the cable cage.

## Moment of Truth

Now we can power on and find out if it works!

If the 5155 is of unknown condition, it is **highly recommended** to **start minimal** with just the motherboard and video card. Remove all extra cards and disconnect the drives.

Plug in and flip the switch!

![Alt text](photos/ibmpc/working.jpeg)

If it works, congrats! You can now add more parts back in and reassemble.

If nothing happens, the tantalum capacitors the +12V and -12V line are often the culprit, you can simply remove them. [More info here](https://minuszerodegrees.net/5150_5160/MDC/tantalum_short_plus_12volts.htm).

For drives, use the harness that came with the PicoPSU.
